    "        \"conversation\": \"Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people? \\n Student: To serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make 20/4 = 5 sandwiches.\\nEach sandwich requires 1+1 = 2 pounds of meat and cheese.\\nFor 5 sandwiches, he needs a total of 2 x 5 = 10 pounds of meat and cheese.\\nThe cost of 10 pounds of meat is 10 x $7.00 = $70.\\nThe cost of 10 pounds of cheese is 10 x $3.00 = $30.\\nThe total cost of meat and cheese is $70 + $30 = $100.\\n 100 \\n Tutor: do you want to talk me through your solution \\n Student: Yes I think my answer is correct. I used 10 pounds of meat and 10 pounds of cheese so I multiplied 7 dollars times 10 pounds for the meat and 3 dollars times 10 pounds for the cheese. That gave me a total of $100 for the meat and cheese\",\n",
